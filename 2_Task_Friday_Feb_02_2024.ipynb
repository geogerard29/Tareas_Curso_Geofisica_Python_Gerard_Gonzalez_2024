The task for this weekend can be developed by groups or an individual way. It will be cool if it is done by groups by exploring the collaborative repositories. It consists of the following:\n","\n","1. Create a Python program that simulates dice throwing.\n","2. The program must allow to the user  to specify the amount of dices and the number of throws to simulate.\n","3. The code must print out to the user the value of each dice thrown in each throw.\n","4. In the form type the link of your repository in which the solution for this task can be found and indicate if you did it alone or in group. In the last case, mention the names of your group mates.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"uSlZNTf00fRP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Solution**"],"metadata":{"id":"XKQKBWvk07xZ"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":43,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"w-n991zF0UBS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1707208541971,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":4870,"user":{"displayName":"Gerard González","userId":"05427065828680846509"}},"outputId":"59732fb1-4f48-4798-de20-a7fe12793219"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Please type the amount of dices to throw: 3\n","Please type the number of throws: 10\n","\n","The values for the dice No 1:\n","Throw No 1: 5 \n","Throw No 2: 6 \n","Throw No 3: 6 \n","Throw No 4: 3 \n","Throw No 5: 5 \n","Throw No 6: 6 \n","Throw No 7: 6 \n","Throw No 8: 6 \n","Throw No 9: 2 \n","Throw No 10: 1 \n","\n","The values for the dice No 2:\n","Throw No 1: 3 \n","Throw No 2: 4 \n","Throw No 3: 1 \n","Throw No 4: 6 \n","Throw No 5: 6 \n","Throw No 6: 2 \n","Throw No 7: 3 \n","Throw No 8: 2 \n","Throw No 9: 5 \n","Throw No 10: 1 \n","\n","The values for the dice No 3:\n","Throw No 1: 4 \n","Throw No 2: 2 \n","Throw No 3: 1 \n","Throw No 4: 4 \n","Throw No 5: 2 \n","Throw No 6: 1 \n","Throw No 7: 1 \n","Throw No 8: 6 \n","Throw No 9: 3 \n","Throw No 10: 5 \n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","amountDices = int(input(\"Please type the amount of dices to throw: \"))\n","throws = int(input(\"Please type the number of throws: \"))\n","\n","oneArrey = np.random.randint(1, 7, (amountDices * throws))\n","oneArrey = oneArrey.reshape(throws,amountDices)\n","\n","for i in range(amountDices):\n","  print(f\"\\nThe values for the dice No {i+1}:\")\n","  for j in range(oneArrey[:,i].size):\n","      print(f\"Throw No {j+1}: {oneArrey[:,i][j]} \")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Optional Challenge**\n","\n","The algorithm must show to the user the most common number, the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum value, and the maximum value for each dice after 10 throws.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"QJPBmFstb-SW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Solution**"],"metadata":{"id":"spj5LH1ViD98"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(\"DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS VALUES\")\n","for i in range(amountDices):\n","  vals, counts = np.unique(oneArrey[:,i], return_counts=True)\n","  mode_value = vals[counts == np.max(counts)]\n","  print(f\"\\nThe most common number is: {mode_value} \")\n","  print(f\"The mean is: {oneArrey[:,i].mean()}\\nThe standar deviation is: {oneArrey[:,i].std()} \")\n","  print(f\"The minumun value is: {oneArrey[:,i].min()}\\nThe maximun value is: {oneArrey[:,i].max()} \")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9E1GsKtviXYO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1707209337516,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":303,"user":{"displayName":"Gerard González","userId":"05427065828680846509"}},"outputId":"612c33ab-8045-480e-b92a-ff35b6a4a89d"},"execution_count":48,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS VALUES\n","\n","The most common number is: [6] \n","The mean is: 4.6\n","The standar deviation is: 1.8 \n","The minumun value is: 1\n","The maximun value is: 6 \n","\n","The most common number is: [1 2 3 6] \n","The mean is: 3.3\n","The standar deviation is: 1.7916472867168918 \n","The minumun value is: 1\n","The maximun value is: 6 \n","\n","The most common number is: [1] \n","The mean is: 2.9\n","The standar deviation is: 1.7 \n","The minumun value is: 1\n","The maximun value is: 6 \n"]}]}]}
